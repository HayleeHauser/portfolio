                <p>
                    Our team redesigned and built a modern social movie tracking app inspired by Letterboxd. We began with wireframes and interactive prototypes, 
                    conducting multiple rounds of user testing to refine the design before development. MovieApp lets users browse movies, create and share watchlists, 
                    rate films, and engage with a community of movie enthusiasts. This project highlights our skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, iterative 
                    problem-solving, and teamwork, demonstrating our ability to deliver polished, user-centered applications.

                    Abduct-o-Moo is a humorous 2D arcade-style game where players take on the role of alien cowboys abducting cows using tractor beams. Set in a fun 
                    farm-themed environment, the game challenges players to capture as many cows as possible while avoiding obstacles. With engaging mechanics and playful 
                    visuals, Abduct-o-Moo blends classic arcade action with a unique twist on the farm and sci-fi genres.

                <h2>Eight Queens</h2>
                <p>
                    The Eight Queens project implements a solution to the classic chess puzzles of placing eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens threaten each 
                    other. Using the hill-climbing algorithm with random restarts, the program iteratively improves the board state to minimize conflicts until a valid solution 
                    is found. The project emphasizes heuristic evaluation, state exploration, and algorithm optimization to efficiently solve the problem. Outputs include the 
                    current board configuration, heuristic scores, and the actions taken during each iteration.
